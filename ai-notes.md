#Scorekeeping app prompts

#Prompt1: Help me build a golf scorekeeping web application that will allow a player to keep track of scores. There should be 1-4 players across 9 or 18 holes. The score should be calculated automatically without a backend.

#Prompt2: Can yo also give help me include a HTML + CSS layout for the app? The app should have a section for selecting the number of players and holes, and a section for entering scores with the totals.

#Prompt3: There also has to be some javascript code that allows for various functionalities. These include saving scores per hole and player, auto-calcutaing totals, storing data in localstorage, supporting clear hole and undo actions, lets users pick 9 or 18 holes, and works efficiently on a mobile. Can you give me an outline of what the Javascript code could look liek for this

#Prompt4: How could I use javascript to ensure that the app restores saved scores and names when the app is reloaded, and if no data exists, ensures the setup screen is shown. 

#Prompt5: How would a reset button be coded in both HTML and then the functionality in javascript for this app. 

#Tools used: I primarily used VS code and Github for the code, and ChatGPT as my AI assistant. 

#Notes: The majority of HTML and CSS code I wrote myself, using AI to clean the code and make it look more efficient. I entered the code I wrote myself as well as the assignment overview as a prompt given to ChatGPT, and that allowed for my HTML/CSS code to be better refined. I used ChatGPT to help me write most of the Javascript code. I asked it to give me an outline of the Javascript code that would add the necessary functionalities to the app. 

#CodeEdits: There was a lot of JSON elements added to the JS code which I actually took out or changed to regular Javascript code, as I felt that these details were not important. 

#Accuracy: These tools have a tendenecy to assume the shapes of variables. These tools are very useful for creating general patterns quickly. 

#Output verification: Manual Code observation for any logical errors such as event wiring. General interacting testing on a web viewport.
